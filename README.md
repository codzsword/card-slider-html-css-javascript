# Responsive Card Slider HTML CSS JavaScript

To create this card slider, we’re using the SwiperJS library—a lightweight and feature-rich JavaScript library for sliders. While there are other options like Owl Carousel and Slick JS, SwiperJS stands out for its simplicity and performance. It doesn’t rely on additional libraries like jQuery, making it faster and easier to integrate into your projects.
